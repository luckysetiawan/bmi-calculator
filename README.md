# BMI Calculator

## About

BMI Calculator is a tool that can help you calculate your body mass index (BMI) then classify your weight status according to your BMI.

Although BMI is simple and widely used, there are several limitations to it that make it not perfect in assessing your health or body composition. For example, BMI is only calculated with height and weight. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether the majority of your weight came from muscle or fat, one can be classified as obese with a low fat percentage. So BMI is not suitable for someone with high muscle mass.
